        <p>Hi! I'm Matthew Shanahan, but I go by Matt. My student number at RMIT is s3943492, and my email is <a href="mailto:s3943492@student.rmit.edu.au">s3943492@student.rmit.edu.au</a>. I struggled to find a good picture of myself; I don't take many pictures and most of them don't look good, but this is what I look like:</p>

            <p>I was born in South Eastern Melbourne and I still live here, although I have been overseas several times with my family and with my secondary school. I have travelled to Thailand, The United States, Canada, Indonesia and China. I finished secondary school at Caulfield Grammar and am now studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I spend a lot of my free time playing video games, and I built my computer as a part of that hobby. I used to play a lot of Rainbow 6: Siege but I don't play it much anymore because I no longer found it fun, More recently I have been enjoying Steep and Risk Of Rain 2 with my friends. Oh and sometimes I spend hours wrestling editing software to make funny videos for Youtube.  I have 2 dogs called Jessie and Chewie and I spend a lot of time at trampoline parks because its a really fun way to get exercise.
