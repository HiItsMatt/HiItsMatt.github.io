        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <p>My Project Idea is an application that will help a user to make cocktail drinks, discover new drinks, and invent their own. To do this, first and foremost, the application will be a database of drinks, their ingredients, and instructions on how to make them. The user will be able to search for a drink of their choice and find the ingredients and instructions to make them. Alternatively, the user will be able to input the ingredients that they have at home, and the application will be able to find what drinks they can make out of the listed ingredients. The third function of the application is that it will be able to recommend new drinks to the user based on their rating of previous drinks. The final function is that a user will be able to invent and save a new drink and receive recommendations on ingredients to add based on how their flavour fits into the drink.</p>

        <p>In Australia, alcohol plays a huge part in our culture; as a country, we drink 100,000,000 glasses of alcohol in any given week and just over 30% of this is spirits. Given this data, my application stands to solve a very simple problem: How can people find new drinks? As it stands, most people find new drinks via word of mouth; a friend recommends a drink that they enjoyed, so you decide to try it. This is inefficient, and it becomes very difficult to learn about drinks outside of what your circle likes. That's where my solution comes in. What if you don't have the ingredients to make any of the drinks you know? well, enter the ingredients you have and find new drinks that you can make. Alternatively, find something completely new that you may like based on your previous tastes. In this way, my application solves the problem of being limited in choice by what drinks you know of, you will be able to find any drink you like, and importantly, any drink that suits your tastes.</p>
            
        <p>As stated before, My application's function is to help a user find and make drinks. It will have four unique functions that allow it to do this. The first function is that it will allow the user to search for the name of a drink, and then present them with a list of ingredients, instructions and a video of how to make the drink that they searched for. This will function by accessing a database of drinks, doing a search algorithm to find the name of the drink and displaying its associated descriptions, images and other data on the page of the application. The second function is that it can tell you what drinks you can make based on what ingredients you already have. This will work by asking the user to input the ingredients that they have on hand, accessing the same database of drinks, but instead of doing a search algorithm for the name of the drink, it will do a search for a list either matching the ingredients or using only some of the ingredients that are inputted by the user. this way the application will only return a list of drinks that the user is currently able to make. Once a drink has been selected, the user will be able to like or dislike a drink. this will be used to apply a value to the ingredients of the drink; when a drink is liked the value of every ingredient will increase when a drink is disliked, the value of every ingredient will decrease because different drinks use different ingredients, this will result in varied values for each ingredient over time, and what is essentially a model of the users taste in drink. The third function of the application is that it will be able to recommend the user a drink based on previously liked or disliked drinks. It will do this by assigning a value to each drink, this value is the average value of the drinks ingredients, and then showing the drink in order of highest to lowest value. since the order of the drinks will change as the user likes and dislikes more drinks, this will eventually reflect their actual tastes. drinks that have previously been liked should be ignored in the recomendations list; it is intended to help a user find new drinks, but if a drink has been liked then it is no longer a new drink. The final function of this application is to help a user invent their own drink. It will do this by giving a user suggestions for new ingredients based on how often those ingredients are used together (so it will work within the context of the drink), as well as the users taste for said ingredient. in this way, the user will be able to create a drink that suits their tastes and also tastes decent to everyone else. To summarise the application: It will have four main pages. the first page will allowe a user to to search the name of a drink an recieve ingredients and instructions on how to make it. the second is that a user will be able to input the ingredients that they have on hand, and receive the name, and the instructions on how to make a drink that they have the ingredients for. the third is that, based on how they like/dislike drinks, they will recieve reccomendations on new drinks to try. the fourth is that a user can invent a new drink, and based on how they like and dislike, they will recieve reccomended ingredients to add to a drink.</p>
        
        <p>I plan to code this application in the python programming language, using the Kivy package to both build the application and upload to the IOS store. I plan to use Python as I am already very experienced with this programming language and through the use of the Kivy package it becomes a viable way to build a product meant for IOS and the iPhone. Doing this would require an Apple macbook in order to upload to the Apple App Store, as they do not allow you to upload from a Windows device. Alternatively, I could develop my application for an Android phone, although we eventually, as while I could get my application onto the Play Store, I have no android device to test my application on. this means that in terms of hardware, either an Apple Macbook or an Android smartphone will be required. </p>
    
        <p>My project will require a large amount of programming, as the main focus of it is to create a functional smartphone application; all of this programming will be done in python, so a skill that is required is extensive knowledge of the python programming language. on top of this, i will be using a package, Kivy, which enabled me to create smartphone applications for both IOS and android, that i have never used before. this means that another skill required is knowledge of the Kivy python package. These skills are quite feasable to find, and I should simply be able to use the internet to learn the basics about what I will need for my application. My extensive knowledge of python should carry me through the project and i will just need to learn about the Kivy package on top of this.</p>

        <p>The success of the project will be based on its basic functionality: does it complete all four functions that I originially planned to include? If it is able to complete all four functions, then we can say that the project is a success. If it can complete 3 functions, then, while I wouldnt call it complete success, I think the result will still be successful at solving the original issue that it was meant to solve. The original issue that was meant to be solved is that people mostly find out about new drinks and how to make them through word of mouth. This application seeks to solve that by creating an accessible database of drinks, and instructions of how to make them that an average person can access. I think that if the project can acheive 3 or more of its functions, then I would consider it a success. The impact its development would have (if it were to become widly popular) is that people would be more knowledgable about drinks in general, and have a much better understanding of what they like and dislike, meaning that they can better select drinks to their own tastes.</p>
