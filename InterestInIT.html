        <h1>Interest In IT</h1>
        <p>My Interest in IT first stemmed from my hobby of playing video games, which started when I was 10 years old and playing Minecraft, but my interest in IT became more focused as something I could do as a career in 2017 when I got my first laptop for school and began taking programming classes as an elective. During 2017, I taught myself simple HTML and CSS over the internet, as web development was something I was really interested in at the time. This interest grew mostly from some family friends that worked in the IT industry at the time. over the next few years, my interest in Information Technology both grew as I continued taking classes that were IT-related or just an IT class. this lead me to learn and become proficient in the python programming language, which while being inefficient, was easy to learn due to its readability and ease of use compared to other languages. eventually, I started making simple games using the PyGame library. My current interest in IT is to learn languages that are more widely used in the IT industry, as programming is something that I enjoy due to the logically creative aspects of inventing an application that solves a real-world issue.</p>

        <p>Put simply: I chose to come to RMIT because it seemed like the next logical step in my education. I knew that I wanted to go to university because I wanted to continue doing what I see as an opportunity to get paid to do something that I enjoy doing, and the question was simply: where can I go that will allow me to continue in the direction I would like to go? Swinburn Institute of Technology was also an option, however, I had been to open days for both universities and far preferred the RMIT campus, and not only that, I know that RMIT has a better standing with potential employers, so ultimately, I chose to come to RMIT.</p>
            
        <p>During my studies, I expect to learn first and foremost about Programming and Application Development; these are both areas that I enjoy and I feel as though skills in these spaces are required for employement within the IT industry and areas related to it. I also would expect to learn about Web Development, things such as more complex HTML and CSS, as well as Javascript and other such languages. This is because web developers are sought after, and I enjoy the creativity that comes with designing a webpage.  My other expectations of what to learn during my studies are Cyber Security and Database Management; this is because these are areas in which I have little to no knowledge, however, I understand that they are highly important as someone that works in the IT industry.</p>
