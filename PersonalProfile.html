        <p>For me, These results pretty accurately reflect how I feel about my behaviour in real life. The Myer Briggs test is a test that evaluates how you act and react to situations, and how you just generally function. This test's results suggest that while I prefer to work through issues logically with my head rather than relying on how I feel about something, I can lack confidence in the result I come up with. I'm pretty sure that I'm intelligent, but finding simple mistakes in my work or misunderstanding something can make me doubt the validity of what I've achieved. I also find it hard to stop overthinking or overanalysing situations and just go with the flow and I enjoy discussions of theoretical ideas and with people who disagree with me because it opens my mind to an alternative way of looking at an issue. It is kind of uncanny how well this profile describes how I feel about certain things, as well as things I have noticed about myself and my actions but do not consciously decide to do.
            
            <br><br>The Learning Styles test is a test that gauges the most effective way for you to study and take in new information. My result being Auditory suggests that I learn better by having new information explained to me rather than learning by figuring it out myself or having it shown to me. This means that I can learn more effectively by associating things with sounds, such as reading flashcards and such.
            
            <br><br>The Human Benchmark is a series of short tests that attempts to measure your capacity for complex tasks, such as verbal, number, and visual short term memory, and also simple tasks, like typing speed and basic reaction time. For me, scoring on average in the 70th percentile means that I am scoring higher than 70% of people in these tasks. A potential employer would be interested in these results as they may reflect general cognitive ability within an individual. </p>

        <p>The results of these tests make me think that my behaviour within a team may be hard to work with, as I prefer to work alone, however it may also open an opportunity for another perspective, as the Myer Briggs test suggests that INTP people are willing to play the devil's advocate just to keep the conversation flowing and to offer another way of looking at the issue. Furthermore, most of the flaws of the INTP personality type stem from working within a group: This is mostly caused by INTP's inability to stay with a conversation as they often get lost in their own head: this results in a lack of communication and can often come across as though they are not listening, even though They are interested in what is being said. INPT peopel may be a benefit to a group by offering opinions or ideas that think outside the box, as they people tend to consider every option, no matter how counterintuitive it may seem at first. </p>
            
        <p>Ultimately, it seems that the Myer Briggs test suggests that I will work the best with people who are also Logicians, as being able to match each other's pace and understand what is going through the others mind is something that is difficult with other personality Types. On top of this, Logicians do not suffer as strongly from the flaws of other Logicians. for example: one Logician will not be offended by another's insensitivity, because the dont care as much about emotion and prioritise rationality as well.</p>
